Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is rapidly getting popular in blockchain networks as it requires far less energy than traditional Proof-of-Work systems. However, PoS still faces critical challenges. Security risks such as long-range attacks, Sybil threats, and the nothing-at-stake dilemma continue to challenge these networks. This paper explores a new approach to validator management in PoS systems by applying machine learning—specifically multi-agent reinforcement learning—to help improve how validators are chosen and monitored over time.

The core idea is to build a system that learns from validator activity and uses that knowledge to make better decisions about which nodes should participate in block validation. What sets this paper apart is the focus on explainability. Alongside the AI models, the system will include methods for making those decisions understandable to users and developers. By integrating explainable AI (XAI), the goal is not just smarter validator selection but also one that is transparent and easier to audit.

This research hopes to lay the groundwork for a more secure and trustworthy PoS framework—one that can adapt to threats as they emerge, without losing sight of the values that make blockchain technology valuable in the first place.
