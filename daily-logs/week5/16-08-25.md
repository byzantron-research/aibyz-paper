### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Best practices for merging real-world and simulated blockchain validator data.
  - Looked into standard practises of writing academic style pseudocode



- **Where did you search?**  
  - Reviewd few academic papers for getting ideas on writing pseudocode
  - Revisited git repos
  - Took help from the chatgpt and perplexity
  

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - IEEE papers on MARL applications in distributed systems.
    - GitHub repositories showcasing MARL implementations in multi-agent environments.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Wrote the pseudocode for Algorithm 2, focusing on MARL-driven validator policy learning
  - Defined environment initialization, agent state representation, action space, reward functions, and iterative training loop.
  - Incorporated trust score updates within the training process.
  

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Understood the importance of embedding trust metrics directly into the policy update cycle.
- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Will start writing pseudocode of next steps/algorithms

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Begin drafting Algorithm 3 pseudocode tomorrow.
