### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Best practices for merging real-world and simulated blockchain validator data.
  - Looked into standard practises of writing academic style pseudocode



- **Where did you search?**  
  - Reviewd few academic papers for getting ideas on writing pseudocode
  - Revisited git repos
  - Took help from the chatgpt and perplexity
  

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - IEEE papers on validator behavior modeling.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Wrote the pseudocode of algorithm 1, that is on how to gather or collect datasets
  

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Learned on how to write academic style pseudocode for a research work
- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Will start writing pseudocode of next steps/algorithms next
