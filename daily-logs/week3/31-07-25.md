### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 31st July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Focused on implementing the pseudocode for MARL Environment Setup and Training Loop on this paper *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Explored the MARL agent design patterns and training loop structures used in decentralized environments

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Visit few git repos to find any relevant code snippets
  - Referred to MARL implementations in GitHub, and tutorials on MARL in multi agent simulations

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - Some git repos, but didn't help much, took help from perplexity

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Drafted and refined the logical pseudocode for Phase 2 and 3 on setting up the MARL environment and training loop.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Struggled a bit while structuring the pseudocode and understanding the approach

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - MARL reward feedback and trust dynamics work well together to mimic realistic validator behaviour

- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Will start drafting the 4th phase on Validator Selection & Explanation Module.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Start drafting pseudocode for adversarial scenarios and policy evaluation in Phase 4.
