### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 31st July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Focused on implementing the pseudocode for  Phase 4 pseudocode and structured all previous phases into a clean, organized  Notebook for this paper *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Explored XAI methods and strategies in PoS


- **Where did you search?**  
  - Reviewed related MARL + XAI implementations on GitHub
  

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - Some git repos, and previously mentioned IEEE papers

   

---

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Drafted and refined the logical pseudocode for Phase 4 on Validator Selection & Explanation Module
  - Structured all the previously written pseudocode from phase 1 to 4 into a notebook.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None for today

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - The full pseudocode now offers a clear, modular pipeline, even though few phase is yet to write.

- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Finalize comments and markdowns in the notebook and will prepare initial plan for Punishment & Auditability Module.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Start drafting pseudocode for adversarial scenarios and policy evaluation and Punishment & Auditability Module in Phase 5 and onwards.
