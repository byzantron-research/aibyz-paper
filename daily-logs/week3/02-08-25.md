### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Final XAI integration implementation patterns (SHAP, LIME)
  - Export functions and model finalization structure


- **Where did you search?**  
  - GitHub repositories for XAI, MARL, and PoS simulation
  - Took help from chatgpt and perplexity.
  

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - https://github.com/shap/shap

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - The pseudocode draft for Phases 5–7 (Punishment, Logging, Export) has been completed
  - Structured the entire notebook pipeline from Phase 1 to Phase 7 with modular blocks, markdown, and inline comments

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None for today

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Using proper references and modular pseudocode makes it easy to repeat experiments and try new things in the future.

- **What’s next?**  
  - Get ready to turn the pseudocode into real code
