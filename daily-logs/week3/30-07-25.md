### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 30th July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Make the initial plan on writing the Pseudocode for gathering dataset for this paper *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Reviewed structure and standards for writing clear pseudocode blocks in research oriented proposals

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Visit few git repos to find any relevant code snippets
  - Referenced pseudocode templates from related AI-driven consensus models

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - Some git repos, but didn't help much, took help from perplexity

   

---

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Drafted and refined the logical pseudocode for Phase 1 of the validator selection pipeline.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Struggled a bit while structuring the pseudocode

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Early logical pseudocode writing clarifies the relationships between feature extraction and real or synthetic data. That's what I have learned today.

- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Will start drafting the second phase of pseudocode on setting up the MARL Environment

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Outline pseudocode for Phase 2: Simulation Environment + MARL setup.
