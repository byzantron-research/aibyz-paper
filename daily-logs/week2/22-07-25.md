### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 22nd July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** To draft the methodology of this project on  ***AI-Driven Validator Selection for Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks solutions in PoS systems*** and develop the methodology architecuture

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Mainly focused on refining each stage of the methodology and aligning it with real-world simulation practices and MARL-XAI integration pipelines.
  - I searched for how other MARL-based blockchain simulators structure their environments and how XAI tools like SHAP/LIME are used in trust modeling. 

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Primarily from google scholar and perplexity.
  - Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, arXiv, and a few GitHub repositories

- **Useful sources found:(Few Revisited)**  
  - https://github.com/emliang/Multi-Agent-RL

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  -  Broke the methodology into seven clearly defined phases — from data preprocessing to open-source reproducibility
  - Structured a textual pipeline flowchart to visualize the interdependencies between simulation, MARL, trust scoring, and XAI.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  -Many MARL research pipelines still use overly simplified environments which gives us an edge in simulating more realistic PoS behaviors

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Realized the value of a visual diagram for both implementation planning and presentation.

- **What’s next?**  
  - Draft initial pseudocode or component-level implementation plan (for MARL training loop, trust calculation, and XAI hooks)

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Will begin to sketch out the simulation logic and agent policy structure using MARLlib or a simplified multi-agent gym environment
