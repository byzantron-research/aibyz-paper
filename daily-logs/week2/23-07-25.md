### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 23rd July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Conduct comprehensive literature review on existing research related to validator selection, reinforcement learning, and explainable AI in PoS blockchain networks.

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Mainly focused on gathering academic sources that explore security limitations in PoS, machine learning-based validator detection, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and the role of XAI in transparency.
  - looked for both foundational papers and recent applications involving MARL and XAI integration. 

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Primarily from google scholar and perplexity.
  - Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, arXiv, and a few GitHub repositories

- **Useful sources found:**

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Explored the transparency limitations of AI in blockchain and the need for post-hoc explainability tools like SHAP and LIME
  - Studied how reputation systems are often rule-based and lack dynamic threat modeling.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - XAI adoption in blockchain is limited eventhough it is used in other department like healthcare and finances.

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Developed a strong theoretical foundation for justifying the proposed use of MARL and XAI in validator selection.

- **What’s next?**  
  - Possibly expand the literature section with one more recent XAI-in-blockchain citation if available

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Finalized the Literature Review section for inclusion in the proposal with references and citations. 
  - Start doing the experiments with the available data.
