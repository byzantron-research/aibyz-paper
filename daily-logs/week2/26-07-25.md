### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 26th July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Planning on gathering datasets for this paper *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Explored publicly available datasets related to validator activity in Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos, and Polkadot PoS networks
  - Looked for validator reputation scoring tools, slashing trackers, and simulation tools for PoS environments 

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Beaconcha.in API docs, Rated.network, Dune Analytics dashboards
  - Referenced IEEE datasets and Google Scholar for hybrid dataset design approaches

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - Beaconcha.in API for Ethereum validator stats
    - Cosmos SDK & Subscan for validator metadata
    - Rated.network for real-time reputation scoring
    - few git repos

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Created summary tables with tools, outputs, and responsibilities for each dataset phase
  - Clarified how synthetic + real-world hybrid datasets will offer our novelty by adding behavioral labels and engineered trust features

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Existing platforms like Rated and Beaconcha.in offer rich validator performance signals usable for trust score modeling

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Merging synthetic agent behavior with real PoS validator data introduces explainable variability that static datasets lack

- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Begin collecting and storing real validator data

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Build simulation module for lazy/Sybil/selfish validator behavior generation
  - Will try to implement Beaconcha.in data fetcher for Ethereum validators
