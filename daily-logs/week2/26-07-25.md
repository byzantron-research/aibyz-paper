### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 26th July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Planning on gathering datasets for this paper *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Find the completeness and logical sequences of the data pipeine based on recent trend/practises in dataset generation for PoS blockchain AI.

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Previously saved IEEE papers, GitHub repositories with MARL validator monitoring tools, and Google Scholar for related visual dataset frameworks.

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - Referenced formats and layout inspirations from MARL and XAI papers to improve clarity and coherence in the flowchart.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Created the complete structured of the full pipeline into 4 phases- Data Collection/sourcing via API, Synthetic data generation, Enrich the data by feature engineering and merge it to make hybrid dataset and finally to publish the dataset in csv,json,parquet(Or maybe in any of the format, possibly Jason) 

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Identified that most published pipelines lack final documentation/export layer clarity, tried to addressed this in today’s flowchart.

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Visual clarity greatly enhances conceptual communication and I rtried to implement it on the  the finalized flowchart of data pipeline.
- **What’s next?**  
  - Start prototyping the Hybrid-Set generator to fuse real and synthetic validator logs.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Will try to implement the scripts to fetch data from real world datas from sites related to Ethereum. Haven't finalized the sources where I should start collecting the data. few sites are in mind.
