### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Reviewd the best practise for writing IEEE style abstract and fixed the minor issues on the abstract of the proposal.
  - Looked into sample abstracts and writing guidelines from IEEE conferences and blockchain research publications. 

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Primarily IEEE author resources and google scholars and took help from perplexity

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - IEEE writing style guides and sample abstracts from conferences like Globecom and ICBC.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Rewrote the abstract to improve clarity, reduce redundancy, and align with academic tone

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Found that most strong IEEE papers have concise abstracts (under 250 words) with very focused wording.
  - Also realized my previous abstract had some overlapping ideas that needed to rephrase.

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Understood the importance of balancing technical detail with clarity in abstract writing

- **What’s next?**  
  - Continue drafting the remaining sections of the paper: Methodology (with diagram), experiment setup, and evaluation plan.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Will try to implement pseudocode and collect data for simulations
