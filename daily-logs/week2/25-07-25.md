### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 25th July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Finalized the abstract, wrote the PR title and summary, and began organizing the methodology section for the project *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Explored IEEE-style PR summaries and how to frame research titles for clarity and impac
  - Looked into MARL based system design patterns and real time validator monitoring architectures in existing literature, sort of revisiting previously explored IEEE papers. 

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Primarily IEEE author resources and google scholars and took help from perplexity

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - IEEE writing style guides and sample abstracts from conferences like Globecom and ICBC.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Refined the final version of the abstract with clarity and formal structure.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Found that my previously written abstract lacks these- adaptive-real time validator monitor, comprehensive attack defense, auditability as novelty area, more emphasis were given to XAI integration. Fixed it in the updated abstract.

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Learned how important it is to explicitly highlight key contributions early in the abstract and summary.

- **What’s next?**  
  - Start drafting the experiment setup and evaluation plan using testnets or simulated validators.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Will try prepare simulation data collection framework like validator behavior logs and reward patterns.
  - Will try to create the dataset with a proper research, also explore existing datasets.
