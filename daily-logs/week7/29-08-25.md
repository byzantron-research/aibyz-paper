### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 29th August, 2025
- **Main Focus:** Consolidated multiple PR-level improvements across config validation, trust scoring, training pipeline cleanup, and notebook alignment, ensuring the project is research-grade, modular, and maintainable.

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**

  - Best practices for dataclass validation and parameter safety checks.
  - Ways to extend trust scoring logic with configurable weights.
  - Methods to simplify redundant training entry points for cleaner structure.
  - Alignment strategies between notebook experiments and modular code.

- **Where did you search?**

  - Python dataclass and Q-learning validation references.
  - Trust update heuristics in prior drafts and notebook implementations.
  - Training wrapper design in modular ML codebases.
  - Research notes and pseudocode structures from the paper.

- **Useful sources found:**

  - Code Rabbit’s validation suggestions for config.
  - Notebook trust update formula and weight handling.
  - Internal notes on modular training pipeline design.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**

  - Added `__post_init__` to the `Config` dataclass to strictly validate trust and Q-learning parameters.
  - Refactored `update_trust` in `trust_score.py` to accept reward and penalty weights, integrating them into the trust update formula.
  - Updated `MARLAgent` to pass these weights consistently during trust score updates.
  - Modified all relevant calls in `train.py` and `main.py` to support the new trust-weighted logic.
  - Removed local/legacy training logic from `train.py`, leaving only a clean wrapper that imports and calls `codes.main.train`.
  - Cleaned redundant imports and ensured the file follows absolute import practices.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**

  - Centralizing trust weight handling simplified both the agent and training loop logic.
  - Removing legacy code revealed how much cleaner the training pipeline becomes when only one entry point is authoritative.
  - Notebook and modular code now align closely, reducing the chance of divergence.

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**

  - Strict parameter validation upfront prevents subtle runtime bugs and makes configuration more robust.
  - Modularizing trust logic with explicit reward/penalty weights supports research flexibility.
  - Simplifying `train.py` to a thin wrapper improves readability and long-term maintainability.
  - Aligning notebook experiments with modular code builds consistency and transparency in the workflow.

- **What’s next?**

  - Expand evaluation scenarios in the notebook to stress-test trust weights and selection rules.
  - Begin integrating SHAP/LIME explanations into the pipeline, moving beyond placeholders.
  - Document the updated training flow and trust logic for collaborators.

---

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**

  - Polish documentation to explain config validation and trust weight usage.
  - Extend the notebook with richer experiments around trust decay and thresholds.
  - Prepare result-driven sections for the paper that leverage the updated, consolidated training pipeline.
