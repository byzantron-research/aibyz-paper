### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 31st August, 2025
- **Main Focus:** Extended trust logic refactor across core modules (`trust_score.py`, `config.py`, `pos_env.py`) with a focus on config-driven reproducibility, state management safety, and cleanup for maintainability.

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**

  - Design patterns for safe environment state handling in RL setups.
  - Best practices for public getter/setter methods in Python class design.
  - Config-driven trust scoring implementations in modular ML codebases.
  - Guidance on consolidating duplicate classes and pruning unused imports.

- **Where did you search?**

  - RL environment management literature and open-source repos.
  - Python class encapsulation and API design references.
  - Prior notebook-to-code alignment drafts and trust scoring notes.
  - Code reviews from earlier commits highlighting redundancy issues.

- **Useful sources found:**

  - Example EnvState handling from Gym-based environments.
  - Internal notes on trust score invariants and parameter defaults.
  - Style and linting recommendations for modular ML repositories.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**

  - Refactored `adaptive_trust_score` in `trust_score.py` to remove hardcoded coefficients, fully relying on config weights.
  - Improved docstrings for clarity and reproducibility.
  - Updated `config.py` to hold `trust_reward_weight` and `trust_penalty_weight` at both class and module level, with pipeline-aligned defaults .
  - In `pos_env.py`, added `get_agent_state` and `set_agent_state` methods to avoid direct `_state` mutation.
  - Ensured `EnvState` covers all required fields for trust scoring and explainability (XAI).
  - Removed duplicate/nested class definitions, fixed indentation inconsistencies, and dropped unused imports.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**

  - Adding public state accessors simplified interactions and reduced risk of inconsistent state changes.
  - Aligning trust logic strictly with config improved reproducibility across experiments.
  - Cleaning up duplicates/unused imports revealed how much lighter and more readable the environment code became.

---

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**

  - Encapsulation (getters/setters) is crucial for maintaining safe environment state transitions.
  - Keeping trust logic parameterized at config level ensures experiments remain consistent and transparent.
  - Small cleanup steps (removing duplicates, unused imports) significantly improve maintainability.
  - The notebook and modular code are now tightly aligned, reducing the gap between prototyping and pipeline execution.

- **Whatâ€™s next?**

  - Expand test coverage for `get_agent_state` and `set_agent_state` to validate stability across training runs.
  - Explore integrating preliminary XAI hooks into `EnvState` for downstream analysis.
  - Document the refactored state handling and trust logic for smoother onboarding of collaborators.

---

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**

  - Update project documentation to explain new state access methods and config-driven trust logic.
  - Extend notebook experiments to stress-test the refactored trust update function.
  - Begin drafting XAI integration points within the environment for upcoming explainability work.
