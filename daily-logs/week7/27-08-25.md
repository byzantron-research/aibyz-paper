### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 27th August, 2025
- **Main Focus:** Implemented core project setup from configuration and dataset alignment through environment creation, agent/evaluation refinements, and initial notebook development.

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**

  - Reliable ways to integrate dataset paths across systems (Windows + portable env variables).
  - Methods to align validator CSV data with environment states.
  - Practices for structuring agent/evaluation code and XAI explanations.
  - Approaches for building a first exploratory notebook around the updated pipeline.

- **Where did you search?**

  - `config.py` and environment setup guidelines.
  - Data loader references for handling NaNs and derived metrics.
  - Existing MARL agent logic and evaluation utilities.
  - Example research notebooks for organizing training and analysis.

- **Useful sources found:**

  - Prior drafts of dataset loader and environment code.
  - Internal pseudocode structure from the paper.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**

  - Updated `config.py` to use local dataset path with raw string for Windows safety.
  - Built and tested `DatasetLoader` to sanitize missing values, normalize stake, and derive uptime.
  - Refined `PoSEnvironment` to return discretized states and shaped rewards with realistic dynamics.
  - Enhanced `MARLAgent`, evaluation logic, and XAI explanations for clarity and trust handling.
  - Connected everything in `main.py` to run end-to-end training and selection.
  - Created a Jupyter notebook to tie the workflow together, visualize results, and validate consistency.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**

  - The uploaded CSV contained many NaNs in attestation/proposal counts, requiring careful defaults.
  - Integrating trust updates directly in the training loop simplified explanation outputs later.

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**

  - Defining dataset paths flexibly is essential for portability across systems.
  - Cleaning and aligning validator data upfront makes the environment much more stable.
  - Incremental refactoring (config → env → agent → evaluation → notebook) builds a coherent workflow without gaps.
  - Even a simple notebook greatly improves understanding and transparency of the pipeline.

- **What’s next?**

  - Expand the notebook with more experiments (trust thresholds, selection variations).
  - Begin drafting result analysis for the paper using the outputs of the updated training loop.
  - Explore adding richer metrics from the dataset as they become available.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**

  - Polish the notebook with clear sections and visuals.
  - Document environment setup and dataset assumptions for collaborators.
  - Transition toward writing the results and discussion sections with notebook outputs.
