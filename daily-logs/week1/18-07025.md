### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 18th July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** To identify limitations in existing AI-driven validator solutions in PoS systems

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Mainly focused on analyzing previously reviewed papers to identify what limitations still exist in AI-based approaches for validator selection and PoS security
  - Looked for gaps in explainability, decentralization, and real-world applicability of current solutions. 

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Primarily from google scholar and perplexity.
  - Revisited the previously found papers from IEEE papers and cross-referenced ideas using Notebook Lm and Perplexity.

- **Useful sources found:(Revisited)**  
  - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10900961 (ecuring Proof of Stake Blockchains: Leveraging Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Detecting and Mitigating alicious Nodes)
  -https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10179426 (Bitcoin-Enhanced Proof-of-Stake Security: Possibilities and Impossibilities)

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  -  Tried to compared the proposed solutions for example, MRL-PoS and Bitcoin enhanced PoS against the previously developed abstract and idea that I have developed.
  - Focused mainly on explainability, adaptability, and validator behavior profiling as core factors often missing in existing works.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Found that most of the models lack explainability (No XAI integration), though they use other ML models like reinforcement learning, but there is a novelty area by integrating XAI with our proposed solutions.
  - Also noticed a paptetrn of specefic type of attack approaches but no self healing mechanisms found yet, hope this could be another area of novelty in our work.
  - Some papers lacked practical disccusion on how these systems would integrate with blockchain layers. (A bit skeptical on this patetrn)

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Understood that the novelty of my approach lies in combining MARL with explainability to create a self-healing, decentralized validator selection system.
  - Learned that existing works still lack transparency and dynamic adaptation, which are critical for trust in decentralized systems
- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Will begin drafting the "Related Work & Limitations" section for my paper, framing how my idea addresses those gaps.
  - Plan to shortlist key limitations for citing in my methodology and justification of novelty.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Start writing the "Limitations in Existing Works" section with proper citations.
  - Map limitations to proposed features (e.g., XAI, adaptive validator scoring, behavioral modeling).
  - Will develop a well structured Methodology for this paper.
