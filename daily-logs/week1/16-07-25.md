### Date & Topic
- **Name:** Stefano Greco
- **Date:** 16th July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** To learn about proof of work(PoS) and validators

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - how PoS works in blockchain tech
  - how it differs with proof-of-work, find that or what I have understand is that PoW relies on computational power
  - Also, I have found out that PoS aims to improve the flaws of PoW regarding energy consumption.

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Primarily from google search, but elaborate understanding is from youtube.( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ucRmZDu-LQ&ab_channel=Mr.Noodles )

- **Useful sources found:**  
  - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8746079 (Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanisms for Future Blockchain Networks: Fundamentals, Applications and Opportunities)
  -https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9974007 (Analysis on Blockchain Consensus Mechanism Based on Proof of Work and Proof of Stake)

  **Note:** These papers helped me to understand in depth of PoS.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Mostly to find the way to see any existing solutions are available there for PoS in terms of having any attacks.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Even though PoW dominates, but is consumes more energy
  - Find out that PoS protocols like Ourobors and Algorand reduce energy consumption, however it faces security challenges like Nothing-at-stake adn Long range attacks

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Learn the differences of Pos and PoW, how they differs and tried to understand which is better in terms of blockchain tech.

- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Planning to find relevant papers/articles for AI Driven validators, understand how validators works.
  - Will try to make a draft for how to find the dataset and the imlementation of architectures require to implement the project with novelty.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Finalize relevant papers, make a simple methodology structure and wills start to write the paper.
