### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 20th July, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** To darft the methodology of this project on  ***AI-Driven Validator Selection for Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Networks solutions in PoS systems***

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Mainly focused on constructing a comprehensive methodology combining MARL and XAI for validator selection in PoS networks.
  - I explored academic papers and technical references that discuss blockchain consensus optimization, trust modeling, and explainability techniques. 

- **Where did you search?**  
  - Primarily from google scholar and perplexity.
  - Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, arXiv, and a few GitHub repositories

- **Useful sources found:(Few Revisited)**  
  - https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhaa075 (Blockchain without Waste: Proof-of-Stake)

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  -  Broke down each part of the methodology I need to implement: simulation, validator agents, trust scoring model, reinforcement learning setup, and XAI layer.
  - Broke down each part of the methodology I need to implement: simulation, validator agents, trust scoring model, reinforcement learning setup, and XAI layer.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  -Most existing ML-driven PoS frameworks rarely cover all three dimensions: adaptivity, auditability, and security together.
  - Realised that in the majority of MARL implementations in blockchain, explainability is purposefully avoided rather than simply absent. This provides our XAI integration with a distinct perspective.

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - I now have a clearer view of how to structure the methodology—starting from simulation setup → agent design → MARL loop → trust score calculation → XAI feedback layer.

- **What’s next?**  
  - I’ll write out the full methodology section in markdown with citations.
  - Might also prepare a visual block diagram of the proposed system to better illustrate component interaction

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Prepare the first version of the "Methodology" section with 6 key blocks --> Problem Identification, simulation environment setup, MARL agent architecture, trust scoring system, xai integration, evaluation metrics
