### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Structure and implementation of MARL agents with trust scoring in modular AI research codebases



- **Where did you search?**  
  - GitHub repositories for understanding the best practises
  - Took help from chatgpt and perplexity.
  - youtube

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Defined a clean abstract interface in base_agent.py using Python’s abc module
  - Tried to implement the ,arl_agent.py with Q learning and integrated the trust aware decision making

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Modular agent design helps in terms of having flexibility to upgrade it to deep LR later

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Understaood on how to maintain the the compatibility across agent, environment and training pipelines

- **What’s next?**  
  - Finish the rest of the code which I need to write

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Start working on gathering the dataset and will try to simulate the next phase.
