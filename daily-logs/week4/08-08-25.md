### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 8th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Focused on implementing the selection, explanation, and punishment modules (evaluate.py, xai/explainer.py, and integrating them in main.py) for the paper *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Best practices for post-training evaluation and ranking in MARL systems
  - Implementation patterns for modular penalty systems in simulations



- **Where did you search?**  
  - GitHub repositories with MARL and trust-based logic for understanding the best practises
  - Took help from chatgpt and perplexity.
  - youtube

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Mainly invest time on writing the main.py, evaluate.py adn the explainer.py. even though, these codes are not finalized and further writing will be needed while experimenting with the results

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Keeping selection, explanation, and punishment modular makes them easier to extend for more advanced models later

- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - May need to spend a bit time on refining the punishment detection. Will start with small dataset first.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Experiment with A SHAP based explainer to see some results
