### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 7th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Focused on implementing the training loop, utility functions, and dataset loading structure for the paper *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Structure of reinforcement learning training loops for multi-agent systems
  - Dataset loading frameworks in ML projects



- **Where did you search?**  
  - GitHub repositories with MARL and trust-based logic for understanding the best practises
  - Took help from chatgpt and perplexity.
  - youtube

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Mainly tried to built the simulation loop of the train.py to integrate environmment and agent interractions.
  - Started writing the utils.py, wrote the important reusable functions and this section will be updated on basis of the necessity
  - Added a minimal dataset loading pipeline, however, its only a draft as we have not created the dataset and the format of the dataset is not finalized, so this section may need to update or adjust on the basis of the finalize datasets.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - Designing logging utilities early made the training loop easier to debug

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Understaood on how to maintain the use the reusablity of functions while writing the utils.py

- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Finish the rest of the code which I need to write.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Start working on gathering the dataset and will try to simulate the next phase.
