### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 4th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Created the full modular code structure and implemented foundational components (config.py, pos_env.py)  for the paper *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Best practices for structuring modular AI research code



- **Where did you search?**  
  - GitHub repositories for understanding the best practises
  - Took help from chatgpt and perplexity.

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Wrote a python script to generate the necessary python files and structured them into folders, whole task was done with a single python script
  - Built pos_env.py with the initial version of the PoSEnvironment class to simulate validator state
  - Implemented config.py to define all global parameters

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None for today

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Understaood the modular approach for writing code.

- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Finish the rest of the code which I need to write

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Start working on gathering the dataset and will try to simulate the next phase.
