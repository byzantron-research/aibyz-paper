### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Designed pseudocode to define multiple scenarios (baseline, adversarial, stress-load).
  - Added loops for running episodes and collecting selections, penalties, and explanations.
  - Computed metrics for security, fairness, performance, and explainability.
  - Implemented export steps to save policies, metrics, and generate report-ready outputs.
  

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None
