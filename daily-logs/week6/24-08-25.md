### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 24th August, 2025
- **Main Focus:** Reviewed and refined all pseudocode algorithms for *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**

  - Consistency in algorithm design and pseudocode formatting.
  - Best practices for structuring multi-algorithm workflows in academic papers.

- **Where did you search?**

  - Prior drafts of Algorithms 1–5.
  - Research papers with multiple evaluation and selection algorithms.

- **Useful sources found:**

  - Internal notes and pseudocode structures from earlier iterations.

---

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**

  - Carefully reviewed Algorithms 1–5 for clarity, flow, and completeness.
  - Verified logical consistency across pseudocode (selection, scoring, trust metric, evaluation).
  - Adjusted minor formatting issues to ensure readability and alignment with paper standards.
  - Confirmed that Algorithm 5 integrates outputs from earlier algorithms correctly.

- **Any patterns or surprises?**

  - None

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**

  - Reviewing the entire set of pseudocode together highlights gaps that are less visible when working on each individually.
  - Consistent pseudocode improves overall paper coherence and makes it easier for readers to follow the methodology.

- **What’s next?**

  - Finalize the pseudocode section of the paper.
  - Start drafting the results and discussion using Algorithm 5 outputs.

---

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**

  - Complete final edits on pseudocode algorithms.
  - Transition into writing the results analysis section with clear references to algorithmic outputs.
