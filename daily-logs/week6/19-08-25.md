### Date & Topic

- **Date:** 19th August, 2025 
- **Main Focus:** Implemented Algorithm 4: Malicious Detection, Penalization, and Audit Trail for the paper *AI-Driven Validator Selection in PoS Blockchain Networks*

---

### 1. Search

- **What did you look for?**  
  - Standard techniques for detecting malicious validator behavior in PoS networks.
  - Approaches for applying penalties and maintaining auditable logs in distributed systems.


- **Where did you search?**  
  - Reviewd few academic papers on anomaly detection in blockchain consensus.
  - GitHub repositories focusing on validator monitoring and penalty enforcement.
  - Prior pseudocode drafts to keep structural consistency.

- **Useful sources found:** 
    - IEEE articles on trust metrics in distributed consensus

### 2. Investigate

- **What did you dig into?**  
  - Designed pseudocode to detect anomalies in validator activities using event thresholds and trust deltas.
  - Implemented penalty logic that reduces trust, with harsher penalties for slashed validators.
  - Added explainability for each penalty decision to highlight triggering factors.
  - Built a structured logging process to store penalties, evidence, and explanations in an immutable record.
  

- **Any patterns or surprises?**  
  - None

### 3. Reflect

- **What did you learn?**  
  - Integrating explainability into penalty enforcement creates both accountability and a research-ready audit trail
- **Whatâ€™s next?**  
  - Will move on to Algorithm 5: Evaluation, Metrics Logging, and Export.

### 4. Actions

- **Immediate actions:**  
  - Start drafting pseudocode for Algorithm 5 tomorrow
  - Review Algorithm 4 for alignment with trust scoring and logging modules
