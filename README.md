Ensuring the dependability and safety of artificial intelligence systems, particularly in the face of unforeseen faults or adversarial scenarios, presents a multifaceted challenge. This research proposal investigates an innovative methodology aimed at enhancing Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) within next-generation distributed systems, especially those that incorporate artificial intelligence, through the deliberate integration of sophisticated machine learning (ML) methodologies. Drawing upon the principles of classical BFT, which permits a system to maintain proper functionality even when certain components behave arbitrarily or maliciously, we propose a framework that utilizes artificial intelligence to develop more adaptive, resilient, and secure consensus protocols. The proposal outlines a comprehensive methodology that amalgamates redundant, diverse AI modules with intelligent, ML-driven consensus mechanisms, anomaly detection, and adaptive parameter optimization, with the objective of counteracting advanced attacks, enhancing performance in fluctuating conditions, and addressing the shortcomings of conventional BFT as well as existing AI safety protocols.
